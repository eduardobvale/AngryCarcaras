**Angry Carcar√°s**

This is a demo project for those who want to study [cocos2D-x-html5](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5) and [box2Dweb](http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb).

You will see that we have four steps till we get some playable game.

The idea is a 'angry birds' like game, so we can see cocos2D integrating with box2D.


**Javascript** is all you need here.
